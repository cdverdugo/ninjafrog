			<h1>What we are about</h1>
			<p class="wwab">Here at the Onion Cafe, we pride ourselves at only serving onions or nothing. Initially, our limited menu was critisized and judged in poor taste, but our ideals run strong, and we continued to only offer 
				fresh nothing or onions for now 30 years. Starting in 1993, our owner Elli found through culinary school, that the only ingredient he needed to please his teachers were onions. Like the great minds of our time, he too dropped school
				in his epiphany of only needing one ingredient. Thats what we do today, with only nothing or onions. Take a seat at one of our lounges and take a taste for yourself, you'll cry at first bite!
